## About

This repository serves as the public source code repository of the **Real Time Flood Monitoring System**.

The flood monitoring system is being developed at EQUINOCT Community Sourced Modelling Solutions, hereafter referred to as EQUINOCT, under the UNICEF Office of Innovation's Venture Capital Fund that supports and guides their inaugural climate cohort of 8 startups from around the world to build Open Source technological solutions for sustainable climate action.
All development activity is coordinated through the [CoS-IT-FloWS github page](https://github.com/COS-IT-FLOWS/RT_Flood_Monitoring_System), where you can also find all archived, current, beta, and development versions of the system.

## Overview

EQUINOCT is an early stage tech start-up formed in July 2020, that aims at building community data portals in data scarce regions that can facilitate real-time visualization, analysis,monitoring, and impact-based early warnings of climate change impacts using data sourced from communities through building local community partnerships.

The Real Time Flood Monitoring System is the first iteration of a decision support system, that provides hyper-local real time monitoring to provide river basin level impact based flood forecasting and multi-hazard warnings. It aims at leveraging meterological and infrastructural data such as rainfall, groundwater and reservoir levels to monitor and depict the current hydrological situation in the region.

## Open Source

We encourage any users who have modified (or would like to modify) the flood monitoring system, either to fix bugs or develop new features, to contact us and coordinate development work with us. The flood monitoring system source code is archived in Git and is publicly available through GitHub. To access the source code, visit GitHub, create an account, and visit [github.com/COS-IT-FLOWS/RT_Flood_Monitoring_System](https://github.com/COS-IT-FLOWS/RT_Flood_Monitoring_System).

CoS-IT-FloWS is an open source development model and is released under the terms of the [MIT License](./LICENSE).
